`component_id`
  :Description: Unique id for a component in the system. This is an instance
                of `component_type`.

  :Data Type:   String.
                It is recommended to use alphanumeric characters,
                starting with a letter, and logically distinct parts
                of the name separated by underscores.

  :Example:     'transformer_tx1'

`component_type`
  :Description: The :term:`typology` of a system component.
                Represents a general category of equipment.

  :Data Type:   String. It is recommended to use alphanumeric characters,
                starting with a letter, and logically distinct
                parts of the name separated by spaces.

  :Example:     'Stepup Transformer'


`component_class`
  :Description: Represent a broad category of equipment performing
                a general task. A number of component types can be
                grouped under this, e.g.
                'Power Transformer 100MVA 230/69' and
                'Power Transformer 50MVA 230/69' are both under
                the same component_class of 'Power Transformer'.

  :Data Type:   String.
                It is recommended to use alphanumeric characters,
                starting with a letter, and logically distinct
                parts of the name separated by spaces.

  :Example:     'Emission Management' -- stacks and ash disposal systems
                belong to different typologies, but both contribute to
                the function of emission management.


`cost_fraction`
  :Description: Normalised value of an instance of a component given as
                as a fraction of the total system cost, wih the total
                system cost being 1.0.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \le x \le 1\}}`

  :Example:     0.03


`node_type`
  :Description: This indicates the role of the node (component) within
                network representing the system. For details, see
                :ref:`Classification of Nodes <model-node-classification>`.

  :Data Type:   String.
                Must be one of these four values in the set:
                ('supply', 'transshipment', 'dependency', 'sink')

  :Example:     'supply'


`node_cluster`
  :Description: This is an optional parameter to assist is drawing
                the system diagram. It indicates how the different
                components should be grouped together.

  :Data Type:   String

  :Example:     'Boiler System'


`operating_capacity`
  :Description: Operational capacity of the component.
                One (1.0) indicates full functionality, and
                zero (0.0) indicates complete loss of functionality.
                Typically at the start of the simulation all components
                will have a value of 1.0.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \leq x \leq 1\}}`

  :Example:     1.0 (default value)


`pos_x`
  :Description: The x-position or longitude value of the component.

  :Data Type:   Float.


`pos_y`
  :Description: The y-position or latitude value of the component.

  :Data Type:   Float.


`site_id`
  :Description: The ID for the hazard location matched to the component.
                This value must match one of the values in the hazard
                definition file under the column of the same header.
                A negative value indicates that the related component serves
                as a modelling artefact and not included hazard impact
                simulation.

  :Data Type:   Int.
