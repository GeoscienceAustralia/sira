`component_type`
  :Description: The type of component, based on the typology definitions
                being used in the system model.
                The entries here are the same as noted under
                :ref:`component_type <dmg_algo_component_type>` in the
                'Component Type Damage Algorithms' table.

  :Data Type:   Alphanumeric characters.

`damage_state`
  :Description: The list of discrete damage states used in defining the
                damage scale being modelled within the system. The 'None'
                damage state is not explicitly listed.
                The entries here are the same as noted under
                :ref:`damage_state <dmg_algo_damage_state>` in the
                'Component Type Damage Algorithms' table.

  :Data Type:   String. Must match set of pre-determined state names.

`damage_state_definitions`
  :Description: The physical damage descriptors corresponding
                to the damage states.

                Example:
                A circuit breaker can be considered to be in an 'Exensive'
                damage state for the following damage definition:
                "Cracking of interrupter casing.
                Interrupter head falling off in some instances.
                In other instances damage to conductor connections."

  :Data Type:   Free text.
